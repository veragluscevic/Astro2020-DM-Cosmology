We discuss observational and theoretical advancements that will play pivotal roles in realizing a strong program of cosmological searches for the fundamental nature of dark matter in the coming decade. We focus on next-generation measurements of the CMB anisotropy and spectral distortions, Ly-alpha forest, galaxies, and cosmological 21-cm signals.
